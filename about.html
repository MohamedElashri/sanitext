            <h2>How SaniText Works</h2>
            <p>SaniText is a tool for detecting and removing potentially problematic characters from text. It helps ensure your text only contains characters you want to allow.</p>

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt><span class="option-name">Detect Only</span></dt>
                    <dd>Identifies suspicious characters in your text without modifying it. This is useful for checking what characters might be problematic before sanitizing.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><span class="option-name">Sanitize Text</span></dt>
                    <dd>Processes your text by removing or replacing characters that aren't in the allowed set. By default, only ASCII printable characters are allowed.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><span class="option-name">Paste from Clipboard</span></dt>
                    <dd>Quickly inserts text from your clipboard into the input area.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><span class="option-name">Copy to Clipboard</span></dt>
                    <dd>Copies the sanitized output text to your clipboard for easy use elsewhere.</dd>
                </dl>
                
                <h3>Options</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt><span class="option-name">Allow Emoji</span></dt>
                    <dd>When checked, common single code point emoji characters (like üòÄ, üëç, ‚ù§Ô∏è) will be preserved during sanitization instead of being removed.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><span class="option-name">Additional allowed characters</span></dt>
                    <dd>Specify specific characters you want to allow, even if they're not ASCII printable. For example, entering "Œ±√±√∏√ß" will allow these specific Greek and special Latin characters to remain in your text.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><span class="option-name">Load allowed characters from file</span></dt>
                    <dd>Upload a text file containing characters you want to allow. Every character in the file will be added to the allowed set. This is useful for handling large sets of special characters.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><span class="option-name">Interactive Mode</span></dt>
                    <dd>When enabled, SaniText will prompt you for each unique disallowed character, giving you the option to keep it, remove it, or replace it with something else. This gives you fine-grained control over the sanitization process.</dd>
                    
                    <dt><span class="option-name">Verbose Mode</span></dt>
                    <dd>Shows detailed information about detected suspicious characters, including their Unicode code points and names. This helps you understand what characters were found and how they were handled.</dd>

                <h3>How Sanitization Works</h3>
                <p>SaniText follows these steps when sanitizing text:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Determines the set of allowed characters based on your options</li>
                    <li>Identifies all characters in your text that aren't in the allowed set</li>
                    <li>For each disallowed character:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In interactive mode: Asks you what to do with it</li>
                            <li>In automatic mode: Tries to replace it with a similar ASCII character if possible, otherwise removes it</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Constructs the sanitized text using your decisions or automatic replacements</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Character Replacement</h3>
                <p>When replacing characters, SaniText uses several strategies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Homoglyph mapping:</strong> Characters that look similar to ASCII (like "Œë" ‚Üí "A") are replaced with their ASCII lookalikes</li>
                    <li><strong>Unicode normalization:</strong> Composed characters are decomposed into their base form when possible</li>
                    <li><strong>Removal:</strong> Characters with no good ASCII equivalent are removed</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="explanation-box">
                <h3>Use Cases</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Sanitize user input to prevent homoglyph attacks or injection of invisible/special characters</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Prepare text data for systems that only support ASCII</li>
                    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Ensure text works in environments with limited character support</li>
                    <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> Convert text with various Unicode characters to a standardized form</li>
                </ul>
